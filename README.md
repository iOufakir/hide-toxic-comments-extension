# Hide-Toxic-Comments-Chrome-extension

Say goodbye to toxic comments, currently supporting Youtube and Twitter. (Chrome extension)

The project requires a back-end service in order to check if the target text is offensive or not.

### Backend project
- In another Github repository developed using SpringBoot; OpenAI API was used to check if the comment is negative or not!

Here is the code in `chrome-extention-openai` branch:
