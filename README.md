# Hide-Toxic-Comments-Chrome-extension
Say goodbye to toxic comments, currently supporting Youtube and Twitter. (Chrome extension)

The project requires a back-end service in order to check if the target text is offensive or not.

(In another Github repository developed using SpringBoot, OpenAI API was used)
